Original Bug Report.

Lisa-Marie tried to export all user accounts from the King’s Cross Portal today to identify users that are still pending.

As you can see from the attached screenshot Isaac Crown is listed as pending, however the export suggests that he is active.

I have highlighted his row on the spreadsheet in yellow to make it easier.

Having looked at this further, ‘Pending’ doesn’t appear anywhere in the report even though they have 3 users in pending in the system. The Status column just doesn’t seem to match what’s happening on the pending accounts

This issue is this line {{const session = await clerk.sessions.createSession({ userId });}}. Equivalent BAPI call [here|https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/sessions/post/sessions].

{noformat}This operation is intended only for use in testing, and is not available for production instances. If you are looking to generate a user session from the backend, we recommend using the Sign-in Tokens resource instead.{noformat}

The [Sign-in token BAPI endpoint|https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/sign-in-tokens/post/sign_in_tokens] looks like it may offer an alternative, but the flow will need to change. More information [here|https://clerk.com/docs/custom-flows/embedded-email-links].

{noformat}To use a sign-in token to sign in and create a session, follow these steps:

Generate a sign-in token for the user using Clerk's Backend API.
Send the user a link containing the token as a query parameter (e.g., https://your-site.com/accept-token?token=<INSERT_TOKEN_HERE>).
On your frontend, detect the token in the URL and use it to initiate a sign-in with Clerk using the ticket strategy.{noformat}"

As a user within the loading bay settings section we want to be able to control the times that the loading bay is available instead of being a blanket set of times, allowing sites to be able to manage the hours which the loading bay is open.

On a per loading bay basis

* Interval (dropdown, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 120, 240)  Default: 15
* Max duration (dropdown, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 120, 240) Default 15
* Opening time (as dropdown, based on interval) Default Midnight
* Closing time (as dropdown, based on interval) Default (Midnight - Max Duration)

All of these fields are required.
We should also update the create form to include the additional fields

If a delivery already exists and you change the opening / closing time and it's before or after that time,

Before you can save the setting, it should pop up and say ""[AIMEE TO CONFIRM]"" and show a list of effected bookings.
